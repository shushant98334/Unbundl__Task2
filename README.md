Explanation of Approach:

1. HTML Structure:

The HTML structure is simple and consists of checkboxes for different chocolate options, a section to display the selected chocolates, and their total price.
2. CSS Styling:

Minimal CSS is used to style the page, making it clean and easy to read.
Flexbox is used to center the content vertically and horizontally.
3. JavaScript (script.js):

JavaScript is employed to handle the dynamic behavior of the page.
Event listeners are added to the chocolate checkboxes to track user selections.
When a checkbox is selected, the script updates the list of selected chocolates and calculates the total price dynamically.
The goal is to create an interactive and responsive interface for users to build their custom chocolate packs.
Reasoning Behind Choices:

HTML:

HTML5 is used for semantic markup.
Structured with simplicity and clarity in mind.
CSS:

Minimal styling is applied for readability.
Flexbox provides a straightforward way to center content.
JavaScript:

Vanilla JavaScript is used for simplicity, as the task doesn't require complex interactions.
Event listeners are used to efficiently capture user actions.
Calculations are performed dynamically to update the UI without the need for a framework.
Overall Design Philosophy:

The focus is on creating a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
Responsiveness is not only in terms of layout but also in providing real-time feedback to users as they make selections.
